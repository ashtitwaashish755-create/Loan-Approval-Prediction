# 🏦 End-to-End Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** to predict whether a loan application will be **Approved or Rejected** based on applicant financial and demographic information.

It demonstrates a complete real-world workflow:

Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Preprocessing → Modeling → Evaluation → Pipeline

The goal is to automate loan approval decisions and help financial institutions make faster, data-driven lending decisions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Banks receive thousands of loan applications daily.  
Manually reviewing each application is time-consuming and error-prone.

Using Machine Learning, we can:

✔ Automate approval decisions  
✔ Reduce risk  
✔ Improve processing speed  
✔ Increase prediction accuracy  

This project solves the problem using **Binary Classification**.
